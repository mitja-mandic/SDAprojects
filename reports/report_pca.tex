    \section{Introduction}
    For the past nearly two years the pandemic of COVID-19 ruled over our everyday lives, changing every aspect of it. Various rules and restrictions were implemented to 
    limit the damage done by the virus, some of which made more sense to us and some less. Yet we have all first-handedly experienced the importance of infectious disease management.
